## Quick Start with Conda
```
conda install -c bioconda unicore
unicore -v
```

### GPU acceleration with Foldseek-ProstT5
Foldseek features GPU-acceleration for ProstT5 prediction under following requirements:
 * Turing or newer NVIDIA GPU
 * `foldseek` ≥10
 * `glibc` ≥2.17
 * `nvidia-driver` ≥525.60.13

Apply `--gpu` option to either `easy-core` or `createdb` module to use it, e.g.
```
unicore easy-core --gpu <INPUT> <OUTPUT> <MODEL> <TMP>
```

<hr>

## Tutorial
### Download sample data
If you are using the conda package, you can download the example dataset from the following link:
```
wget https://unicore.steineggerlab.workers.dev/unicore_example.zip
unzip unicore_example.zip
```
If you cloned the repository, you can find the example dataset in the `example/data` folder.

### Download ProstT5 weights
You can preliminarily download the ProstT5 weights required to run the `createdb` module.
```
foldseek databases ProstT5 weights tmp
```

### Run the easy-core module
The `easy-core` module processes all the way from the input proteomes to build the phylogenetic tree based on their structural core genes.
Use the following command to run the easy-core module:
```
unicore easy-core example/data example/results weights tmp
```

If you have a CUDA-compatible GPU, add `--gpu` flag to run ProstT5 with GPU acceleration.

### Check the results
After running the `easy-core` module, you can find the results in the `example/results` folder.
 * `proteome` folder contains the proteome information parsed from the input files.
 * `cluster` folder contains the Foldseek clustering result (clust.tsv).
 * `profile` folder contains the taxonomic profiling results and metadata of defined structural core genes.
 * `tree` folder contains the results from the phylogenetic inference.

#### Phylogenetic tree
`example/results/tree/iqtree.treefile` is the concatenated structural core gene tree represented in Newick format. <br>
Each node in the tree represents a species, labeled with their input proteome file name.

#### Structural core genes
`example/results/tree/fasta` folder contains subfolders named after the defined structural core genes. <br>
Each subfolder contains the amino acid sequences (aa.fasta) and their 3Di representations (3di.fasta) of the core genes.

## Manual
We provide an easy workflow module that automatically runs the all modules in order.
* `easy-core` - Easy core gene phylogeny workflow, from fasta files to phylogenetic tree

Unicore has four main modules, which can be run sequentially to infer the phylogenetic tree of the given species.
* `createdb` - Create 3Di structural alphabet database from input species
* `cluster` - Cluster Foldseek database
* `profile` - Taxonomic profiling and core gene identification
* `tree` - Phylogenetic inference using structural core genes

Run each module with `unicore <module> help` to see the detailed usage.

### Input
Unicore requires a set of proteomes as input to infer the phylogenetic tree. Please prepare the input proteomes in a folder.\
You can also refer to the example dataset in the `example/data` folder or download it from [here](https://unicore.steineggerlab.workers.dev/unicore_example.zip).

> Note. Currently, proteomes in `.fasta` format are only supported as an input. We will try to support more types and formats that can represent species.

Example dataset:
```
data/
└─┬ Proteome1.fasta
  ├ Proteome2.fasta
  ...
  └ ProteomeN.fasta

```

### easy-core workflow
`easy-core` workflow module orchestrates four modules in order, processes all the way from the input proteomes to the phylogenetic tree.

Example command:
```
// Download ProstT5 weights as below if you haven't already
// foldseek databases ProstT5 /path/to/prostt5/weights tmp
unicore easy-core data results /path/to/prostt5/weights tmp
```

This will create a `results/tree` folder with phylogenetic trees built with the structural core genes identified from the input proteomes.

The `easy-core` module will also create folders named `results/proteome`, `results/cluster`, and `results/profile` with intermediate results for `createdb`, `cluster`, and `profile` module, respectively.

### Modules
#### createdb
`createdb` module takes a folder with input species and outputs 3Di structural alphabets predicted with ProstT5.

This module runs much faster with GPU. Please install `cuda` for GPU acceleration.

To run the module, please use the following command:
```
unicore createdb data db/proteome_db /path/to/prostt5/weights
```
This will create a Foldseek database in the `db` folder.

If you want to select the GPU devices, please use the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable.

* `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` to use GPU 0.
* `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1` to use GPU 0 and 1.

#### cluster
`cluster` module takes a `createdb` output database, runs Foldseek clustering, and outputs the cluster results.

On default, clustering will be done with 80% bidirectional coverage (-c 0.8).<br>
You can feed custom clustering parameters for Foldseek via `--cluster-options` option.

Example command:
```
unicore cluster db/proteome_db out/clu tmp
```
This will create a `clu.tsv` output file in the `out` folder.

#### profile
`profile` module takes the database (`createdb` output) and cluster results (`cluster` output) to find structural core genes.

On default, the module will report the genes that are present in 80% of the species as a single copy. You can change this threshold by `-t` option.

Example command:
```
// 85% coverage
unicore profile -t 85 db/proteome_db out/clu.tsv result
```
This will create a `result` folder with the core genes and their occurrences in the species.

#### tree
`tree` module takes the core genes and the species proteomes to infer the phylogenetic tree using the alignments of the structural core genes.

On default, alignment will be generated by `foldmason` and truncated by 50% gap filtering, followed by phylogenetic inference using `iqtree`.

Example command:
```
unicore tree db/proteome_db result tree
```

This will create a `tree` folder with a concatenated alignment, partition file, and the resulting phylogenetic trees in Newick format.

You can also use `--no-inference` option to skip the phylogenetic inference and only build the concatenated alignment with a partition file.

```
unicore tree db/proteome_db result tree --no-inference
```

#### gene-tree
`gene-tree` module takes the output folder of the `tree` module and infer the phylogenetic tree for each core gene.

Each phylogenetic tree will be saved in the `tree/fasta/{gene_name}` directory.

On default, the module will reuse the alignment computed from the `tree` module.

Example command:
```
unicore gene-tree tree
```

If you want to recompute the alignment for each core gene, you can add `--realign` option, which will build and filter the MSA again.

You can also use `--name` option to provide subset of hashed gene names to infer the phylogenetic tree.

The list of hashed gene names can be created and be used with `--name` by running the following command:
```
// Create a list of hashed gene names
awk -F"\t" 'NR==FNR {a[$1];next} ($3 in a) {print $1}' /path/to/original/gene/names db/proteome_db.map > /path/to/hashed/gene/names
// Run gene-tree with the list of hashed gene names
// Also optionally use --realign option to recompute the alignment and --threshold option to filter the MSA
unicore gene-tree --realign --threshold 30 --name /path/to/hashed/gene/names tree
```
